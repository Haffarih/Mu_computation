# µ computation
calculation/simulation of X-ray attenuation coefficients (µ) and intensity ratios (I/I0) for different products/materials - Interactive code for easy and simple use. 
## Mu_functions.py
Moldule containing the different functions used for µ and I/I0 computation.
## Mu_main_code.py
This corresponds to the main code for calculating both µ and I/I0 in which "Mu_functions" module is imported.
When lauching the code, an interactive insertion will take place.
